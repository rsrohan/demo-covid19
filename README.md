# Name of the App

## Problem Statement

COVID-19 pandemic has become a cause of worldwide destruction. <b>One of the main challenges is tracking and breaking the spread.</b> People over the world have been practicing social distancing, despite this, a recent WHO report reveals there are as many as 50-60 times more cases than the documented cases.
We need technology that tracks people with vulnerability and ensures social distancing for everyone.
We believe smartphones are one such technology which may help people and government in these dark times.

## Proposed Solution

What if you get a trigger from your phone if you violate social distancing or you met a vulnerable person? Its human nature to forget these norms while communicating, and that’s what awareness is all about. Also what if one need not remember all the people he/she met during any pandemic. 

We bring up an idea through an application platform where user can ensure social distancing and along with it, if a person gets a virus then all other people directly or indirectly are vulnerable gets notified about the vulnerability. Multiple questionnaires based on data available for various stages of symptoms and spread of the virus in body will lead to realtime tracking of vulnerability with the help of AI.
In this way, we will be able to break the spread chain, enforce social distancing and respective authorities will get the data to track vulnerable people as well.

## How The App Works

### For User
